            <p>
              I'm a B.Tech in Computer Science Engineering student at Lovely Professional University, 
              passionate about creating innovative software solutions and exploring the DevOps ecosystem.
            </p>
            <p>
              My academic journey has equipped me with strong foundations in programming languages, 
              software development methodologies, and testing frameworks. I'm particularly enthusiastic 
              about DevOps, automated testing, and continuous integration/continuous delivery pipelines.
            </p>
            <p>
              As a developer, I thrive in dynamic environments that challenge me to learn and adapt quickly. 
              My ability to multitask efficiently, adapt to new technologies, and self-motivate allows me 
              to deliver quality results even under pressure.
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm actively seeking opportunities to collaborate on projects that push the boundaries 
              of what's possible with technology and contribute to meaningful solutions.
